# BusyBus
BusyBus is one of my very first projects with HTML/CSS since 1999. Yeah, you read that right. That's the last time I built a site because I've been making videos in the meantime BUT now I'm back at it. A lot has changed and gotten easier. Thank you for grids and automated syntax. LOVE THIS! Also, GitHub is a dream come true.

Sneak a peak. It's pretty primitive and was part of a learning project to practice some simple grid and responsive layout. It works best in Developer Mode.

Also, checkout the evolution with the two branches off the Master.

Nice to still be learning!

**BusyBus : Kickback and Relax Transit App**
Task: Create a simple layout design for a transit app screen that makes it easy for a user to digest those overly complicated city bus schedules. You know the ones I mean.
